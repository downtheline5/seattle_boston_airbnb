Jupyter notebook was installed using Anaconda: https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
XGBoost package: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started.html

# Data
The data files are provided in the repository and were obtained from Kaggle:
1. Seattle Airbnb dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle
2. Boston Airbnb dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston

# Project motivation
This article is an assignment for the Udacity data scientist specialization where I was asked to pick any dataset from
Kaggle and get some insights from it. I picked the Seattle and Boston Airbnb datasets to answer some interesting questions:
1. Does availability drive price?
2. Do review ratings have anything to do with price?
3. What features are important for one to be a Superhost?

# Files
